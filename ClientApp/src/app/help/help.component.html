In order to start using he app, click on budget management. If you have not registered, you will be taken to a page where you can either login or sign up. I may integrate logging in with facebook, google, etc., but for now click on sign up. You will be asked to enter a username, email, and password. Once you sign up, you will be taken to the main part of the application. You will see dropdown lists where you can select a month and year to start budgeting. These always default to the current month. Next you will see a place for total income. This is where you would enter your total income for the month. You may change this at any time, but the more accurate you are the more accurate your budgeting will be. Then click submit. After that you will be able to add categories. These might include rent, cable, utilities, etc. There is no limit to the number of categories you may have. Enter an amount for each category you intend to spend that month. The recurring checkbox, if checked, will add that category to next month's budget when it is created. This is useful for things like rent and cable that you know will be the same every month. As you add categories, you can see how much money you have spent and how much you have left to budget. If you are using a screen reader, most of the time it will announce the money you have left to budget. It doesn't do this all the time, and I'm not sure why. The goal is to budget every dollar of your income into one of the categories. In the future, I will implement transactions so that you may enter your transactions as you go along and see how your actual spending matches against your categories. I would also like to implement "funds" in the future that would be similar to categories except that they would calculate a running total to indicate savings, possibly with an interest rate, but i'm getting ahead of myself. I hope you enjoy what you see so far, with more hopefully to come soon. My goal is to be simple but effective.

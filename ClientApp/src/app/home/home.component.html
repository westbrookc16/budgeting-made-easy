<h1>Hello All</h1>
Welcome to my very simple budget management app. This is purely a learning project for me ot learn the angular framework, and I offer it here in case it may be useful to someone. My aim is to show that a modern app can be visually appealing and accessible at the same time. Right now I'm sure I could use improvement on both scores. I would also like to add features as time and interest allows. I will be making the code open source and will be putting a link here in case anyone is interested in having a look and/or contributing. Thank you for your interest, and happy budgeting!!

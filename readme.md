Thank you for your interest in my project. I am using this project to help me learn more about angular, accessibility, and many other things along the way. I welcome feedback and help from anyone. I am blind myself, and my goal with this project is to create a budgeting app that is pleasant to use for both blind and sighted alike. The sight is currently hosted at https://budgetingmadeeasy.azurewebsites.net though I may change that if a cheaper host meets my needs, I haven't decided yet. Please feel free to get in touch with me at westbchris@gmail.com. Right now I really need help wit the visual aspects of the sight as well as some accessibility issues. I know what I want but am not sure how to achieve it. Thanks again for your interest.
